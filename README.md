## <b>What is Rasa?</b>

<img src="https://github.com/HUMADEX/SMILE-PRO-Chatbot/blob/main/docs/rasa_logo.jpg" alt="Rasa Logo">

Rasa is an open-source machine learning framework for building conversational AI assistants. It provides a flexible platform for developers to create chatbots and virtual assistants that can understand natural language, engage in meaningful conversations, and perform tasks.

### <b>Key Components of Rasa</b>:

<b>Rasa NLU</b>: This component is responsible for understanding natural language input. It uses machine learning models to extract entities and intents from text.

<b>Rasa Core</b>: This component handles the conversation logic. It uses state machines to track the conversation context and determines the appropriate response based on the user's input and the current dialogue state.

<b>Rasa X</b>: This is a visual interface for building and testing Rasa assistants. It provides tools for creating custom NLU models, designing conversation flows, and analyzing bot performance.

### <b>Advantages of Using Rasa</b>:

<b>Flexibility</b>: Rasa offers a high degree of customization and flexibility, allowing you to tailor your chatbot to your specific needs.

<b>Open-source</b>: Being open-source, Rasa is freely available and has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support.

<b>Scalability</b>: Rasa can handle large-scale conversational AI applications, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes.

<b>Integration</b>: Rasa can be easily integrated with other systems and services, such as databases, messaging platforms, and APIs.

## <b>Patient-reported Outcome Measures List</b>:


### <b>Penn-State Worry Questionnaire for Children (PSWQ-C)</b>
The PSWQ-C is a 14-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess worry in children and adolescents aged seven to seventeen. The questionnaire was designed to be comprehensible to children at the second grade reading level and above. Respondents are asked to indicate how often each item applies to them by choosing from the following responses for each item: “never,” “sometimes,” “often,” and “always.” Their responses are scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 3 (always). Items 2, 7, and 9 are reverse-scored from 0 (always) to 3 (never), with greater scores indicating less worry rather than greater worry. Subsequently, item scores are summed to yield a total score (Chorpita et al., 1997). Total scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating
greater tendency to worry.

### <b>Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)</b>
This seven-item self-report measure screens for symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder in adults aged 18-24. It assesses the frequency of symptoms such as feeling nervous, restless, or easily fatigued. When screening for anxiety disorders, a score of 8 or greater represents a reasonable cut-point for identifying probable cases of generalized anxiety disorder; further diagnostic assessment is warranted to determine the presence and type of anxiety disorder. Using a cut-off of 8 the GAD-7 has a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 76% for diagnosis generalized anxiety disorder [2,3]

The following cut-offs correlate with level of anxiety severity:

Score 0-4: Minimal Anxiety
Score 5-9: Mild Anxiety
Score 10-14: Moderate Anxiety
Score greater than 15: Severe Anxiety

Based on a recent meta-analysis, some experts have recommended considering using a cut-off of 8 in order to optimize sensitivity without compromising specificity [2].

### <b>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for Adolescents (PHQ-9-A)</b>
The Severity Measure for Depression—Child Age 11–17 (adapted from PHQ-9 modified for Adolescents [PHQ-A]) is a 9-item measure that assesses the severity of depressive disorders and episodes (or clinically significant symptoms of
depressive disorders and episodes) in children ages 11–17. Each item on the measure is rated on a 4-point scale (0=Not at all; 1=Several days; 2=More than half the days; and
3=Nearly every day). The total score can range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depression. The raw scores on the 9 items should be summed to obtain a total raw
score and should be interpreted like: 0-4: None; 5-9: Mild; 10-14: Moderate; 15-19: Moderately severe; 20-27: Severe.
