Rasa is an open-source machine learning framework for building conversational AI assistants. It provides a flexible platform for developers to create chatbots and virtual assistants that can understand natural language, engage in meaningful conversations, and perform tasks.

<b>Key Components of Rasa</b>:

<b>Rasa NLU</b>: This component is responsible for understanding natural language input. It uses machine learning models to extract entities and intents from text.

<b>Rasa Core</b>: This component handles the conversation logic. It uses state machines to track the conversation context and determines the appropriate response based on the user's input and the current dialogue state.

<b>Rasa X</b>: This is a visual interface for building and testing Rasa assistants. It provides tools for creating custom NLU models, designing conversation flows, and analyzing bot performance.

<b>Advantages of Using Rasa</b>:

<b>Flexibility</b>: Rasa offers a high degree of customization and flexibility, allowing you to tailor your chatbot to your specific needs.

<b>Open-source</b>: Being open-source, Rasa is freely available and has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support.

<b>Scalability</b>: Rasa can handle large-scale conversational AI applications, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes.

<b>Integration</b>: Rasa can be easily integrated with other systems and services, such as databases, messaging platforms, and APIs.

<b>Patient-reported Outcome Measures List</b>:


<b>Penn-State Worry Questionnaire for Children (PSWQ-C)</b>: The PSWQ-C is a 14-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess worry in children and adolescents aged seven to seventeen. The questionnaire was designed to be comprehensible to children at the second grade reading level and above. Respondents are asked to indicate how often each item applies to them by choosing from the following responses for each item: “never,” “sometimes,” “often,” and “always.” Their responses are scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 3 (always). Items 2, 7, and 9 are reverse-scored from 0 (always) to 3 (never), with greater scores indicating less worry rather than greater worry. Subsequently, item scores are summed to yield a total score (Chorpita et al., 1997). Total scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating
greater tendency to worry.
