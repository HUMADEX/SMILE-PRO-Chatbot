## <b>Patient-reported Outcome Measures</b>


### <b>Penn-State Worry Questionnaire for Children (PSWQ-C)</b>
The PSWQ-C is a 14-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess worry in children and adolescents aged seven to seventeen. The questionnaire was designed to be comprehensible to children at the second grade reading level and above. Respondents are asked to indicate how often each item applies to them by choosing from the following responses for each item: “never,” “sometimes,” “often,” and “always.” Their responses are scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 3 (always). Items 2, 7, and 9 are reverse-scored from 0 (always) to 3 (never), with greater scores indicating less worry rather than greater worry. Subsequently, item scores are summed to yield a total score (Chorpita et al., 1997). Total scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating
greater tendency to worry.

### <b>Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)</b>
This seven-item self-report measure screens for symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder in adults aged 18-24 (Spitzer et al, 2006). It assesses the frequency of symptoms such as feeling nervous, restless, or easily fatigued. When screening for anxiety disorders, a score of 8 or greater represents a reasonable cut-point for identifying probable cases of generalized anxiety disorder; further diagnostic assessment is warranted to determine the presence and type of anxiety disorder. Using a cut-off of 8 the GAD-7 has a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 76% for diagnosis generalized anxiety disorder (Plummer et al, 2016; Kroenke et al, 2007).

The following cut-offs correlate with level of anxiety severity:

Score 0-4: Minimal Anxiety
Score 5-9: Mild Anxiety
Score 10-14: Moderate Anxiety
Score greater than 15: Severe Anxiety

Based on a recent meta-analysis, some experts have recommended considering using a cut-off of 8 in order to optimize sensitivity without compromising specificity (Plummer et al, 2016).

### <b>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for Adolescents (PHQ-9-A)</b>
The Severity Measure for Depression—Child Age 11–17 (adapted from PHQ-9 modified for Adolescents [PHQ-A]) is a 9-item measure that assesses the severity of depressive disorders and episodes (or clinically significant symptoms of depressive disorders and episodes) in children ages 11–17 (Johnson et al, 2002). Each item on the measure is rated on a 4-point scale (0=Not at all; 1=Several days; 2=More than half the days; and 3=Nearly every day). The total score can range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depression. The raw scores on the 9 items should be summed to obtain a total raw score and should be interpreted like: 0-4: None; 5-9: Mild; 10-14: Moderate; 15-19: Moderately severe; 20-27: Severe.

### <b>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</b>
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 is the major depressive disorder (MDD) module of the full PHQ. Used to provisionally diagnose depression and grade severity of symptoms in general medical and mental health settings. Scores each of the 9 DSM criteria of MDD as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day), providing a 0-27 severity score. The last item (“How difficult have these problems made it for you to do your work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people?”) is not included in score, but is a good indicator of the patient’s global impairment and can be used to track treatment response. Higher PHQ-9 scores are associated with decreased functional status and increased symptom-related difficulties, sick days, and healthcare utilization.

### <b>Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-12)</b>
There are different versions of the CYRM and ARM that you can use to measure resilience. These include the basic age appropriate versions: The CYRM-R (for 5-9 years and 10-23 years), and the ARM-R (for 18+). For each age group, there are 3- and 5-point Likert scale versions. There are also versions with simplified language for individuals with limited comprehension. Finally, there are Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) versions of each measure that can be completed by an individual who knows the target individual well. In the user’s manual developers provide a guide to help you decide the best measure for your study. The statements are completed on either a three- or five-point scale. Responses are summed by the administrator to get a measure of an individual’s resilience. You can find out more about scoring and subscale scoring in the user’s manual: https://resilienceresearch.org/download

### <b>Brief Resilience Scale (BRS)</b>
The brief resilience scale (BRS) was created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. The BRS is comprised of 6 items. Items 1, 3, and 5 are positively worded while items 2, 4, and 6 are negatively worded. The BRS is scored by reverse coding items 2, 4, and 6, and finding the mean of the 6 items. The Likert Scale for the BRS is as follows: 1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree, 5=strongly agree. The BRS is a single-page activity where you assign a score between 1 and 5 to a series of statements. The scores (added and divided by the number of statements) determine your personal BRS score (1.00 – 2.99: Low resilience; 3.00 – 4.30: Normal resilience; 4.31 – 5.00: High Resilience). The higher the score, the higher your resiliency.

### <b>Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS)</b>
The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing scale was developed to enable the monitoring of mental wellbeing in the general population and the evaluation of projects, programmes and policies which aim to improve mental wellbeing (Tennant et al, 2007). WEMWBS has 2 scales: the original 14-item scale and the short 7-item scale. The scales have been validated for use in: 1. A wide variety of different geographical locations, languages and cultural contexts, and 2. Many different settings including the workplace, schools, health services and community wellbeing projects e.g. creative arts, gardening and walking groups. 

The WEMWBS is scored by summing the scores for each of the 14 items, which are scored from 1 to 5. Scores range from 14 to 70 and higher scores indicate greater positive mental wellbeing. The idea of wellbeing is fairly new, therefore, it is difficult to fully interpret what the scores mean for each individual. However, you can see how individual’s scores compare with national survey data (from adults) and find additional information on interpretation here: https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/med/research/platform/wemwbs/using/howto/

### <b>Climate Change Anxiety Scale - Short-form (CCAS-S)</b>
Stage 1 employed the Climate Change Anxiety Scale (Clayton & Karazsia, 2020), a measure of climate anxiety and its impacts on personal well-being. It is composed of 13-items rated on a five-point Likert-type scale from 1=“never” to 5=“almost always,” with two factors measuring cognitive-emotional (items 1–8) and functional (items 9–13) impairment due to climate change. Cognitive-emotional items include “I think, ‘why can't I handle climate change better?’” and functional impairment items include, “My concerns about climate change interfere with my ability to get work or school assignments done.” . In consultation with adolescents, the 13-item Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS) was adapted to create the Climate Change Anxiety Scale – Short-form (CCAS-S) which consists of four-items adapted from the original CCAS (Wu et al, 2023).

### <b>System Usability Scale (SUS)</b>
The system usability scale (SUS) is a simple, ten-item attitude Likert scale giving a global view of subjective assessments of usability. It was developed by John Brooke (1996) at Digital Equipment Corporation in the UK in 1986 as a tool to be used in usability engineering of electronic office systems. SUS is a short 10-item questionnaire (each question with a Likert scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree) designed to measure the usability of a system. The SUS is a well-designed, balanced survey consisting of 5 questions with positive statements and 5 questions with negative statements, with scores ranging from 0 to 100.

### <b>User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire (USEQ)</b>
The USEQ is a questionnaire designed to assess user satisfaction with a specific product, service, or system. It aims to capture users’ perceptions, opinions, and overall satisfaction regarding their experience. The USEQ typically consists of multiple items or statements that users rate on a scale, reflecting their level of satisfaction. The questionnaire covers various dimensions such as usability, functionality, aesthetics, and overall satisfaction. The USEQ is a 6-item questionnaire with a 5-point Likert Scale. The total score ranges from 6 (poor satisfaction) to 30 (excellent satisfaction). All items are affirmative, except item 5, which is a negative item. The numerical value of the affirmative items is used to calculate the score. The negative item subtracts the numerical value of the response from 6 and then adds this result to the total score. The USEQ score is evaluated using the following classification: poor (0-5), fair (5-10), good (10-15), very good (15-20), or excellent (20-25) satisfaction.

### <b>User Experience Questionnaire Short (UEQ-S)</b>
The user experience questionnaire (UEQ) is a widely used questionnaire to measure the subjective impression of users towards the user experience of products. The UEQ is a semantic differential with 26 items. The short version, which is named UEQ-S, contains two subscales (pragmatic and hedonic quality; 4 items each) and a total value reflecting the overall user experience. The short version UEQ-S is only intended for specific scenarios which do not allow employing a full UEQ. The UEQ-S does not allow measuring the detailed UX qualities Attractiveness, Efficiency, Perspicuity, Dependability, Stimulation and Novelty, which are part of the UEQ report.The UEQ-S has the items that are scored from -3 (most negative evaluation) to +3 (most positive evaluation).
