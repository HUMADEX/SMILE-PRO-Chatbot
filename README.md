<b>Conversational AI by RASA Framework for Mental Health Assessment Tools</b>

<b>Description</b>:

This repository contains a curated list of psychometric instruments (PROs) suitable for assessing various mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, and resilience. The PROs are organized by age group and target construct.
All coding was developed by using Rasa Framework. 

<b>PRO List</b>:

<b>Penn-State Worry Questionnaire for Children (PSWQ-C)</b>: This 16-item self-report measure assesses worry in children aged 10-17. It measures the frequency and intensity of worry across various domains, such as school, family, and friends.

<b>Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7):</b> This seven-item self-report measure screens for symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder in adults aged 18-24. It assesses the frequency of symptoms such as feeling nervous, restless, or easily fatigued.

<b>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for Adolescents (PHQ-9-A): </b>This nine-item self-report measure assesses symptoms of depression in adolescents aged 10-17. It measures the frequency of symptoms such as feeling sad, hopeless, or having trouble sleeping.

<b>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9):</b> This nine-item self-report measure assesses symptoms of depression in adults aged 18-24. It measures the frequency of symptoms such as feeling sad, hopeless, or having trouble sleeping.

<b>Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-12):</b> This 12-item self-report measure assesses resilience in children aged 10-17. It measures positive coping skills, optimism, and social support.

<b>Brief Resilience Scale (BRS): </b>This six-item self-report measure assesses resilience in adults aged 18-24. It measures the ability to bounce back from adversity and maintain positive emotions.

<b>Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS): </b>This 14-item self-report measure assesses general mental well-being in adults. It measures positive feelings, such as happiness and satisfaction, as well as negative feelings, such as stress and anxiety.

Rasa is an open-source machine learning framework for building conversational AI assistants. It provides a flexible platform for developers to create chatbots and virtual assistants that can understand natural language, engage in meaningful conversations, and perform tasks.

<b>Key Components of Rasa</b>:

<b>Rasa NLU</b>: This component is responsible for understanding natural language input. It uses machine learning models to extract entities and intents from text.

<b>Rasa Core</b>: This component handles the conversation logic. It uses state machines to track the conversation context and determines the appropriate response based on the user's input and the current dialogue state.

<b>Rasa X</b>: This is a visual interface for building and testing Rasa assistants. It provides tools for creating custom NLU models, designing conversation flows, and analyzing bot performance.

<b>Advantages of Using Rasa</b>:

<b>Flexibility</b>: Rasa offers a high degree of customization and flexibility, allowing you to tailor your chatbot to your specific needs.

<b>Open-source</b>: Being open-source, Rasa is freely available and has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support.

<b>Scalability</b>: Rasa can handle large-scale conversational AI applications, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes.

<b>Integration</b>: Rasa can be easily integrated with other systems and services, such as databases, messaging platforms, and APIs.
